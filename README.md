# Optimization_Algorithms_Matlab

Academic repository with some optimization algorithm implementations using matlab.

	1. Gradient Method to minimize f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+2*z^2-x*y-y*z-x*z; x,y,z unconstrainted.
	2. Genetic Algorithm to minimize f(x,y,z) = 0.2*x^2+0.08*y^2+0.18*z^2+0.1*x*y+0.04*x*z+0.06*y*z; constrainted
	3. Simulated Annealing Algorithm to maximize f(x,y) = 9*x+24*y+x*y-x^2-6*y^2; constrainted
	4. Particle Swarm Optimization to minimize f(x,y) = (x-3)^2+(y-5)^2; x,y unconstrainted.
